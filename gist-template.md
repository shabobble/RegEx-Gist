# Regular Expressions - Email Validation

Regular expressions are a great method for performing validation in your code without relying on an external library, and are becoming increasingly popular recently. They can look a bit arcane from the outside, but understanding them is worth the read.

## Summary

A popular use for regular expressions is to validate that a provided string is an e-mail address. Such an expression may look like this: 

```
`/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`
```
